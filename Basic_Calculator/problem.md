# Basic calculator

Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

```
Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7
Example 2:
```
```
Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1
Example 3:
```
```
Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
Note:
```

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
Do not use the eval built-in library function.
